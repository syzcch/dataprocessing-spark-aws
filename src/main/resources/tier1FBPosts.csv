Feedback on Auckland Council's 21 draft local board plans 2017 closes on Friday 30 June É?? so don't miss the chance to have your say on the future of your community.

Developed every three years, local board plans set the direction and the priorities local boards will focus on. The plans cover everything from local parks and playgrounds to sports facilities, town centre development, protecting the environment, community events and more.

Local board plans also influence how local boards provide input into Auckland Council's regional strategies and plans, such as the 10-year budget, and the way in which local boards work with other organisations for the benefit of local communities.
Auckland Council's General Manager of Local Board Services, Karen Lyons, says the draft plans are based on the ongoing feedback and ideas from people about what they most want in their community.

""It could be more places to play sport, improving our parks, holding more free events, or any number of things that make communities better places to live,"" she says.

""Now the local boards want to know if they've got it right, if they've missed anything out, or if the community's priorities have changed.

""Don't miss the opportunity to help shape the future of your local community and neighbourhood É?? go to shapeauckland.co.nz to have your say.""

Feedback forms and the full draft local board plans can be found online at shapeauckland.co.nz. They are also available at libraries, service centres and local board offices.

After consultation closes on June 30, the local boards will review all feedback and use it to help shape the final local board plans. The final plans will be adopted by October 2017.",,status,,42907.8066,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,6,1.1298E+14,Media,1,0,0,0,0,1,1
112979752060616_1743928405632401,"David Parker - Much More Than A Developer
Along with Ponsonby News Editor, Martin Leach, I talked recently to David Parker at his offices at 56 Brown Street in Ponsonby.

David and his brother John, have worked on a number of local developments, both commercial and residential, around the greater Ponsonby area and beyond for 30 years, and yet they are far from household names.

Parker Brothers began as a construction company in 1984. They won the original contract to rebuild Victoria Park, when it had a demolition order on it, beating off Fletchers and others. They also refurbished The Textile Centre in Parnell, for the Amos and Barker families with their architect Roley Adams.

While some property developers are well known and often not far from controversy, Parker Brothers have always been low key, not seeking the limelight, with never a sniff of controversy.

David now solely owns the Brown Street property, which has been recently renamed FRANK PARKER HOUSE after his father. His office is located in the building where he has some 25 different tenants. He still lives locally in Herne Bay, but is spending a lot of time on his new venture, a 26 lot subdivision at Mangawhai, on a property he has owned since 2008.

David Parker is of Ngapuhi and English ancestry. His mother was of Maori and Croatian ancestry, a Stipich and his father was a bricklayer from England. He is proud of his ancestry, and although born in Grey Lynn and living most of his life in central Auckland, his Mangawhai property is dragging him willingly back to his Northland and Ngapuhi roots, which he is reconnecting with at 59 years old. Photos of his father, grandfather and great grandfather are proudly displayed on the wall behind his office desk, all working class men.

He jokes that he lived the first six months of his life in a drawer instead of a cot, in a house on Rose Road.

Sadly, David Parker lost his first wife Jacqui to breast cancer. He nursed her for four years, and she died leaving two young children. Determined to make a difference, David and John poured significant money and energy into 'Fight for Life' and other charities over the years to support both youth suicide and breast cancer treatments, particularly the introduction of herceptin. This unheralded philanthropy has included three quarters of a million dollars raised for Youthline to intergrate a comprehensive nation wide phone system by 'Fight for Life'.

David Parker's family moved to West Auckland when he was still young where he attended Kelston Boy's High. He then went on to Auckland University and graduated in Civil Engineering.

Among his early mentors were John and Tytti Spencer, owners of Caxton Printing. I wouldn't be who I am today if they hadn't taken in hand an angry young 17-year-old from West Auckland, he told us. He helped the Spencers build factories in Samoa and spent a lot of time with them and their family on Waiheke Island.

We asked David if he'd had problems with leaky buildings which have plagued inner city Auckland in recent years. He reported that he had not, as we never used untreated timber, he said.

David Parker has always had a protester's streak about him and was anti the springbok tour, he realises the difficulties facing 'brown' New Zealanders, but he thinks we've started to turn the corner on many of the racial issues. He is positive about the future of his children and grandchildren. His daughter Tallulah is in her second year at the Auckland University, completing a BComm/LIB with a major in Economics and Finance with specialisation in law, under a University of Auckland Maori and Pacific Scholarship and is maintaining a steady A Grade GPA, to prove that her scholarship was not a soft entry to Law School.

David supports the Treaty settlements and hopes that Maori will use the money effectively to advance their iwi and all Maori.

It was when we asked David what comes next that his maturity and values came clearly into focus. This is a man who has found himself. He has a lovely second wife, Corrina, a gorgeous 6-year-old daughter Ava and is now setting out to make a difference.

Mentoring my children, that's next, he told us. Sam is nearly 25 and working in London. I would like him home to help me at Mangawhai. He has been in London since he was 18, having been in the British Army until a serious accident and is now working in the corporate world.

If things go bad for the world, David will have created a haven for many lucky people, back on the land. He has already overseen the planting of 30,000 plus native trees and plants on the sections at Mangawhai. The native birds and bees are returning.

Build a decent four lane highway to Whangarei soon, David pleads, get Ngapuhi's treaty settlement done, and concentrate on jobs in the north, especially for Maori.

David Parker may have been born in Auckland, but he is returning to the Ngapuhi soil which is so much part of his heritage. His ancestors would be proud of him - successful in the big wide world, but wanting now to give something back and return to his ancestral roots. He may not be a household name in Auckland despite his business and charity work, but rest assured he will make a huge mark on his chosen rural retreat, as he mentors his family and then their families.

The next twenty years will be an exciting time for all the Parker whanau. (JOHN ELLIOTT)",Ponsonby News,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PonsonbyNews/photos/a.161000457258545.33778.112979752060616/1743928405632401/?type=3,42906.82108,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,15,1.1298E+14,Media,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

For the third year, Grey Lynn 2030 Waste Away (GLWA) is hosting its plastic bag-free event, joining in the International Plastic Bag Free Day movement. In the past, Grey Lynn's 2 Countdown supermarkets have joined other local retailers by removing or discouraging the use of plastic bags in their stores for the day. BYOB: Think Beyond Plastic will feature bag-making activities, a multimedia corner for kids and adults, displays of plastic bag alternatives and compostable bag samples, artwork from local students, giveaways from EcoStore, etc. Speakers begin at 1:00pm and will include Mayor of Auckland, Phil Goff , Key Speaker; Denise Roche, Green MP and advocate for a plastic bag- free New Zealand; and Kristy Lorson, Zero Waste blogger and Founder of Zero Waste in NZ.

BYOB: Think Beyond Plastic will highlight the detrimental environmental effects of single-use plastic bags, while inspiring people to change their behaviour to be proactive and think about their impact on the environment. Plastic bags have been in use for only 35 years - major supermarkets in the United States did not implement their use until 1982, with New Zealand following suit in 1983. Plastics do not go away but degrade into micro particles, potentially leaching toxics into water sources and slowly entering the food chain. In an ocean environment, plastics have created massive trash mounds, larger than the state of Texas, comprised of billions of bits of microplastic that have been photodegraded by the sun.

Colinda Rowe, Chair of Grey Lynn 2030, says, ""New Zealanders use over 1 billion plastic bags per year: On average, each one is used for 15 minutes before being discarded. Many then end up in the marine environment, causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of marine animals, globally.

""Many cities and countries around the world have recognised the damage caused by single use plastic bags and have taken action to ban or put a charge on bags, resulting in a dramatic decrease in plastic bags used.

""Grey Lynn 2030 Waste Away group and many other groups and organisations around New Zealand are taking action this July to raise awareness and demonstrate to the New Zealand government that we too should be following suit and banning the bag. Auckland prides itself on its beautiful beaches and marine environment - we should not soil it with our plastic trash.""

Bring Your Own Bag: Think Beyond Plastic will take place on 2nd July, 2017 in Grey Lynn, at The Bank Hall, at the corners of Tuarangi and Great North Roads. Sustainable food truck Very Good Dumplings will be located outside the venue, offering nutritious food for purchase on compostable tableware. Grey Lynn 2030 Waste Away's goal is to help people to move forward towards a plastic bag-free future. BYOB will be multi-media, hands-on, educational and proactive - and ultimately a way to positively take responsibility for our collective waste.

Enthusiastic students from Kohia Terrace School, EpsomÉ??, É??Auckland, are engaging with the MéÅui Dolphin Challenge by picking up 63 pieces of rubbish for four weeks and much more. The school Challenge team comprises of 27 students, aged six and seven.

Kohia Terrace School Teacher Katie Williams said: ""The kids are super excited about this Challenge. We have done many activities about MéÅui dolphins, including written reports, art work, and picking up rubbish every day and tabling it.

""At school our focus for this term is endangered and extinct animals, and we chose to study MéÅui dolphins É?? a NZ native and found really close to Auckland, which the children could easily relate to.""

In the words of Kohia Terrace School students:

""MéÅui dolphins are important because they are endangered and are only found in NZ! We need to protect them."" (Xinyu and Mayoori) 

""We wanted to take on the challenge to help save the dolphins. Also, we like learning about them."" (Enzo and Blake) 

""Tell everyone to stop littering and pick up their rubbish. And tell the fishermen to not use set netting and make it law!"" (Jamie and Chloe)

WWF-New Zealand Campaigner David Tong said: ""MéÅui dolphins are found only off the west coast of the North Island É?? nowhere else in the world, and they're right on the brink of extinction""É??. 

""Together we're aiming for a world where MéÅui dolphins are a common sight in the waters of Aotearoa New Zealand, but to achieve this goal we need help.""

This year's Challenge has attracted the support of a diverse range of New Zealanders including passionate people from the Auckland region. 

Auckland-born actress based in Los Angeles, Anna Hutchison (from North Shore) starred on Shortland Street, Go Girls, Power Rangers and Underbelly, and is also getting behind the Challenge. Anna was upset to hear that there are only an estimated 63 MéÅui dolphins remaining, so for the month of June she is running 63km a week to help raise funds.

Grey Lynn-based stencil artist Flox is offering up the chance to win a limited edition Flox Sea Walls Digital Print as her Challenge. Every person who donates will be in the draw to win a wonderful print which features the beautiful MéÅui dolphin. 

The youngest Challenger,É??É?? É??four-year-old Scarlett from Waiatarua, loves MéÅui dolphins and wants to help protect them. She is not only baking cookies and picking up rubbish, but spreading the word about these animals with presentations to her kindergarten friendsÉ?? É??and local primary schools.   

Eight-year-old Meme from Port Waikato is picking up rubbish from her local beach for 63 minutes and is writing a 63-word letter to the New Zealand Prime Minister asking him to help MéÅui dolphins.

Marayke and Rose from Remuera are planting 63 trees each in regional parks around Auckland. 

The folk from Herne Bay's Dear Jervois caf«∏ feel very strongly about the environment and wildlife. They are giving the proceeds from Unicorn White Hot Chocolates to support MéÅui dolphins for 63 days as their Challenge.

Ripe Deli (at Grey Lynn) is selling their famous worm juice for $4 a bottle and donating all the proceeds to the Challenge. They are extremely passionate about MéÅui dolphins, and are raising awareness with their customers and in the community.

Award-winning singer-songwriters are joining forces to combat human trafficking at two Auckland gigs in July. 
 
Holly Arrowsmith, New Zealand Tui Award 'Best Folk Album 2016' winner and Silver Scroll nominee, Aro and Aaron//David will perform two free intimate gigs on Friday July 14, at Grey Lynn Library Hall, and Saturday July 15, at The Rose Centre,  as part of the 'Stand with Her Tour'. The tour seeks to support Tearfund New Zealand's efforts to combat human trafficking in the Asia-Pacific region.
 
""It's an honour to be part of this tour, sharing honest music and stories of freedom to fight modern-day slavery,"" says Arrowsmith. ""Every time we use our choice, we vote for the world we want to live in. I would hate to wake up one day and realise I have only used it for myself. That's why I'm choosing to stand with victims and survivors of human trafficking.""
 
The Stand with Her Tour will unveil music from Arrowsmith's new folk album, due to be released later this year, following last year's debut award-winning For the Weary Traveller.
 
""There are certainly traits running through the new album that echo the first album, including my devotion to nature and its lessons. This time, however, cities, and the characters I have met along the way have found their way into the story. It is stripped back and more true to my live performances, which I really love.""
 
Auckland-based duo, Aro (formerly Chem), and Aaron//David, lead singer of the Waikato band, Wilderness Love, will also play new music from their 2017 debut EPs on the tour.
 
The Stand with Her Tour is presented by Tearfund in support of its anti-trafficking and exploitation work overseas. Tearfund takes a comprehensive approach in dealing with modern slavery, from prevention through to rescue and rehabilitation of trafficking survivors. This includes the prosecution of human traffickers. Audiences will hear from anti-trafficking expert, Sarah Scott-Webb, and can sign-up to a $30 monthly pledge to help protect the vulnerable from exploitation.

To celebrate MéÅori New Year, Aucklanders will see landmarks across their city illuminated in an orange halo.
 
Rising from its centre, the Sky Tower will bathe the city in colours reminiscent of the breaking dawn. The Sky Tower will remain lit up from festival launch, Saturday 10 June, until the Te Korakora on Federal festival, Thursday 22 June.
 
""We're proud to have our iconic Sky Tower as the centrepiece of Matariki, a sight Aucklanders can enjoy from many different vantage points É?? from Te Atatu Peninsula to Takapuna, Mt Albert to Mission Bay,"" says John Mortensen, Chief Operating Officer, SKYCITY Entertainment Group. 
 
Watch the eastern sea wall of the Viaduct transform into a mesmerising wonderland as it casts a golden glow across the harbour. Viaduct Harbour together with Philips Lighting will work to harness the creative potential of this new permanent lighting installation designed by Angus Muir. For the duration of Matariki, between 6 - 11pm the sea wall lighting will take on the added effect of stars to echo the Matariki constellation rising in the north east.  
 
Viaduct Harbour Holdings Chief Executive, Angela Bull, says, ""we're excited Viaduct Harbour's lighting installation is complete just in time for Auckland's celebration of Matariki.  There is nothing more festive than lighting and it's a fantastic way to draw people together to enjoy our city during winter.""
 
Framing the city's cultural hub, Aotea Square, a special light show will also illuminate the Auckland Town Hall with images from host iwi artists Star, Aroha and Ra Gossage. The NgéÅti Manuhiri wahine tell their story in a captivating narrative stretching across past, present and future as a tribute to their late father Peter Gossage and their iwi.
 
Auckland Museum's building and Auckland Transport's Te Ara I Whiti cycleway will also shine in honour of Matariki's star cluster along with another fourteen buildings and landmarks to mark the start of TéÅmaki Makaurau's three week mid-winter festival.
 
""This year, thanks to the huge support from local businesses and organisations getting in behind the Matariki Festival, we're able to bring this beautiful sunrise colour to life throughout the city and start the festival on a bright note,"" says Councillor Cathy Casey, Community Development and Safety Committee Chair.  
 
""The colour is significant because at this time of year the Matariki constellation rises in the north east near the same point on the horizon as the sun. ""
 
Auckland building owners and managers are encouraged to join the festivities if they are able and light up in celebration.
 
This year's festival, hosted by NgéÅti Manuhiri, begins on 10 June with a dawn karakia at TéÅwharanui Regional Park with celebrations running until 2 July.

Auckland Mayor Phil Goff today launched Million Trees, a programme for greening Auckland which will plant a million predominantly native trees and shrubs across the region over three years.

At a launch event hosted by Wesley Intermediate School, the Mayor and local children planted trees and shrubs in the Oakley Creek catchment and revealed Million Trees partnerships with Department of Corrections and Trees That Count that will help put 170,000 plants in the ground in the programme's first year.

The launch also opened Te Whangai Trust nursery which will be donating trees and plants to the Mayor's programme and the Mayor announced the first tranche of plantings for 2017 allocating 30,000 trees for both the North West Wild Link and Puhinui projects, 25,000 trees and shrubs for Atiu Creek on the north Auckland border and 15,000 plants for both the Whau River project and Project Twin Streams in Henderson.

Million Trees formed a key part of Phil Goff's mayoral campaign. It seeks to make Auckland a greener more beautiful place while providing carbon sinks to offset greenhouse gases and prevent siltation of Auckland's harbours and waterways by planting along streams and coastal areas. 

""Million Trees is an ambitious programme to green our city, offset our carbon emissions, protect our water quality and improve our living environment,"" says Mr Goff.

""The response to Million Trees has been fantastic. The enthusiasm and energy of Council, local boards, the private sector and schools has been overwhelming. We are partnering with Department of Corrections, Trees That Count, and nurseries, communities and other organisations to green our city and deliver a natural asset to Aucklanders for generations to come.

""The million trees project is about involving all of our community in making Auckland a better place to live and enhancing our living environment.""

Corrections Northern Regional Commissioner Jeanette Burns says, ""We are pleased that offenders can be involved in this valuable project and give something back to the community.

""Community work offenders do unpaid work in the community to pay something back for the offence they have committed. It also gives them an opportunity to take responsibility for their offending and learn new skills and work habits.

""Employment opportunities give prisoners the chance to develop work habits and gain skills and qualifications that will lead to sustainable employment and contribute to our goal of reducing.""

Sir Stephen Tindall, co-founder of The Tindall Foundation (which funds Trees That Count), encourages Aucklanders to get involved.

""We see our valued partnership with the Council as a way not only of getting a million additional trees and shrubs into the ground, but also as a springboard to encourage the participation of all Aucklanders in planting more native trees in their neighbourhood, on their farm, at school or outside their office. Planting native trees is one of the best things we can all do for the local environment and for the planet. It is also a great way to bring people together and connect them with their local community,"" says Mr Tindall.

Partnering to green Auckland

The partnership with the Department of Corrections will deliver nursery space for growing trees and shrubs. Prisoners and offenders serving sentences of community work in the Auckland region will assist with site preparation, planting and maintenance. 

Trees That Count will assist with planting trees and undertake a robust and independent running count of the trees delivered within the programme. 

Mr Goff says, ""The partnership with the Department of Corrections is crucial. It gives us the scale required to meet the Million Trees target, and having Trees that Count on board will ensure we are accurately reporting what we deliver.""

Mayor Phil Goff was joined by representatives from the Department of Corrections, Trees that Count, Te Whangai Trust, Wesley Intermediate School and the local community to plant trees in the Oakley Creek catchment in Mt Roskill.

Wesley Intermediate also commemorated the occasion with a 100 metre long mural designed by its pupils depicting the Million Trees programme and other local environmental community initiatives. The mural can be seen by the public by visiting Mt Roskill's War Memorial Park.

112979752060616_1723138064378102,"Grey Lynn Greenways opens
Celebrations were in order at Grey Lynn Park last Friday as the community came out to mark the opening of a new shared path and cycling facility from Great North Road to West End Road through the heart of Grey Lynn. 

The idea for the route was first developed by the WaitematéÅ Local Board as part of the WaitematéÅ Greenways Plan adopted in July 2013. Auckland Transport and the New Zealand Transport Agency have been working with the WaitematéÅ Local Board since then to deliver the Grey Lynn Greenways route which will make travel through the area safer and more enjoyable and attract new walkers and people on bikes.
 
The Grey Lynn Greenway route is part of a range of cycling and walking improvement projects in design and under construction in the inner west suburbs aimed at providing high quality ways for people to travel by bike or on foot around their local area and to and from the city.
 
Mayor Phil Goff says, ""This route came about because of the vision of local people to link up green spaces with safe walking and cycling connections. The route is great for the community, improves safety and creates real transport choice for people in the area.""
 
Pippa Coom, WaitematéÅ Local Board Chair says, ""We're really excited to see our first greenway open. The route provides a great link through our parks and will connect to the new Richmond Road and Great North Rd cycleways due to be completed by 2018 and connections to future cycleways at West End Road, Williamson Ave and Bond Street.  We're also fortunate that the community has got behind the Grey Lynn pump track and the pollinator path planting located along the greenway.""
 
Walking, Cycling and Road Safety Manager for Auckland Transport, Kathryn King says, ""Working with our partners we are now half way through our three year programme of building cycling infrastructure to serve the needs of a growing Auckland. People tell us that they want to go by bike but want to use safe routes where they feel protected. Projects like this will increase the number of people we see leaving the car at home and getting active as they travel around their community and to and from work and study.""
 
This route runs through three reserves, Cox's Bay, Hakanoa and Grey Lynn where the path has been widened. The on road sections of the route include traffic calming, better crossing opportunities and a roundabout which make people on foot and bikes more comfortable.
 
Auckland Transport is working with project partners Auckland Council and the Government through the NZ Transport Agency and the Urban Cycleways Programme on a $200m programme of cycle improvements from 2015 to 2018.  The project cost around $1.5 million dollars from Local Board funding, Auckland Transport and the New Zealand Transport Agency.

112979752060616_1712863452072230,"Vector and Auckland Council partner to light Auckland Harbour Bridge
 
The Auckland Harbour Bridge will soon have permanent coloured lighting which - in a world first É?? will be powered by solar energy and battery, and can be transformed into special event lighting displays.
 
As part of the multimillion dollar energy efficiency partnership between Vector and Auckland Council, the iconic landmark will be the first bridge in the world to have all its lighting - operational, structural and special event - able to be powered entirely by solar-stored energy. The LED lights will be individually controlled, capable of transforming the bridge with lighting shows for special events and occasions.
 
Six hundred and thirty solar panels and one gigantic energy storage battery, producing enough energy for 200 homes, will power the bridge lights, and the energy system will also be able to supply power for use in Wynyard Quarter.
 
Lighting the bridge with energy efficient LED lights and sustainable energy generation represents the next phase of a ten-year partnership between Vector and Auckland Council.  Together, they are already promoting the use of energy efficient technology in homes and schools via a community programme in Auckland's southern suburbs.
 
Auckland Mayor Phil Goff said, ""The harbour bridge is an icon of Auckland. Lighting it up will make the city at night a more interesting and vibrant sight.
 
""Powered by solar energy it will also reflect our commitment as a city to energy efficiency, sustainability and low carbon emissions.
 
""It's great to partner with Vector on this project. I welcome their vision and their commitment to making Auckland a more interesting and better place to live.""
 
Vector has forged an international reputation as an innovator in the energy sector regularly collaborating with global technology leaders. Chief Executive Simon Mackenzie said the capabilities learnt as a result means it has developed the expertise to deliver this world first.
 
""No one will ever look at the bridge in the same way when the new lights are turned on and it will highlight Vector's commitment to making sustainable energy available to the businesses and homes of Aucklanders,"" Mr Mackenzie said.
 
""At Vector, we are at the forefront of sustainable innovation, reshaping how energy is distributed so Aucklanders have a choice in how they store and use it. Through the partnership with Auckland Council we are bringing world leading technology to Auckland's Harbour Bridge and the communities in the region.""
 
The NZ Transport Agency, which manages the bridge infrastructure is pleased to support the use of new technology and to work with Vector and Auckland Council towards delivering a forward thinking and energy efficient method of showcasing such an iconic Auckland landmark.
 
""The bridge has been an integral part of the city since it was built more than 50 years ago and we're delighted to be using sustainable resources to bring it to life at night,"" says NZ Transport Agency Chief Executive Fergus Gammie.
 
The NZ Transport Agency has a separate project to replace the existing road lighting with energy efficient LED lights over the next 18 months.
 
About the lights
 
The bridge will feature nearly 90,000 LED lights and 200 floodlights, using just half the energy of standard lighting and lasting five to seven times longer. Lights will only need to be replaced every 10-15 years meaning maintenance crews will spend less time on the bridge. One of the key benefits of using large numbers of individually controlled LEDs, is that the intensity of each light can be regulated.
 
The new bridge lighting will be fully compliant with illumination requirements under the coastal marine provisions of the district plan.
 
More than 630 solar panels will be installed close to the bridge while a large scale 500kW/1MWh utility battery will store the energy - enough to power 200 houses for more than two hours.
 
The planning and installation of the lights is expected to take several months once council planning, consenting and NZTA approval processes have been completed. A special event will mark the official turning on of the lights and the transformation of an Auckland icon into a global icon.
 
Vector and Auckland Council Energy Efficiency Partnership
 
Vector and Auckland Council have committed to work together to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.
 
Vector, which is contributing multi-millions of dollars to the project, will meet the bulk of the costs in operating and maintaining the new lights while Auckland Council will fund digital programming of the lights, special events activations and promotion. Council will also explore the possibility of commercial arrangements overtime to further enhance the support of existing and new lighting projects and events.
 
The partnership's other initiative, the Efficient Energy Communities Project, which includes Entrust, is delivering 10,000 free LED lightbulbs, hot water heat control units and home energy advice to homes in Papakura and Takanini.
 
Ten local organisations, eight schools, two kindergartens, and two community facilities, will also each receive an energy saving Tesla Powerwall É?? a solar-driven battery that delivers reliable electricity around the clock. The provision of energy efficient technology is also being complemented by an education programme in local schools which promotes simple actions that families can take to reduce energy bills.

112979752060616_1708098632548712,"430 BUNGY JUMPS IN 24 HOURS - AND A NEW WORLD RECORD SET

Aucklander Mike Heard has just completed 430 Bungy jumps off the Auckland Harbour Bridge within 24 hours É?? more than two and a half times the number of jumps achieved by the previous record holder.

Mr Heard, who broke the Guinness World Record for the most Bungy jumps in 24 hours, just 4.5 hours into his effort, says the experience has far exceeded his expectations.

""It's been a huge effort and I'm absolutely stoked that, with the support of the AJ Hackett Bungy New Zealand team, we've been able to achieve our goals of a world record, as well as raising funds and awareness for the Mental Health Foundation.""

""I'm not sure what I'm going to do next to top this but I'll be heading home to the family tonight for some rest and relaxation,"" he says.

AJ Hackett Bungy New Zealand Managing Director Henry van Asch says Mr Heard's effort is an extraordinary one.

""Our philosophy is that if you can Bungy jump, you can do anything. And Mike has taken that to a whole new level today.""

""To Bungy from the Auckland Harbour Bridge 430 times in a 24 hour period is a phenomenal achievement, and I'd like to congratulate Mike and the whole Bungy team for a great result.""

Shaun Robinson, Chief Executive of the Mental Health Foundation, says the organisation has been delighted to be involved.

""Mike and the team have shown amazing generosity and kiwi go-for-it attitude! He has smashed the record, which is awesome. He's raised thousands of dollars, which is great.  And he has touched so many peoples lives, encouraging us all to talk about mental wellbeing and reach out and support one another.""  

Mr Heard brought the record back to New Zealand - the 'original home of Bungy' - when he beat Australian Beau Retallick's 2014 record of 158 jumps.

Aucklanders have the chance to play a part in shaping the future of their local communities and neighbourhoods from today until Friday, 30 June.

Auckland Council's 21 local boards want feedback on their draft local board plans, which will help guide decisions on local activities and projects.

Local Board Plans are developed every three years and the proposed outcomes in them cover everything from local parks and playgrounds, to sports facilities, town centre development, protecting the environment, community events and more.

They also influence how local boards provide input into Auckland Council's regional strategies and plans, such as the 10-year Budget, and the way in which local boards work with other organisations for the benefit of local communities.

Mayor Phil Goff says it's important for Aucklanders to have their say about the future of the places where they live.

""It is vital Aucklanders make their voices heard on the issues that matter to them. I encourage every resident to have your say on how best your 21 Local Boards can serve our communities,"" he says.

Auckland Council's General Manager of Local Board Services, Karen Lyons, adds: ""Many of the great things happening in our communities are a result of local people providing their ideas and input.

""Local Board Plans are designed to reflect each community's priorities and preferences and all Aucklanders can have their say by going to shapeauckland.co.nz.""

During the six-week consultation period, people will be able to find out more and talk with local board members face to face at a series of local meetings.

A list of meeting dates, feedback forms and the full draft local board plans can be found online at shapeauckland.co.nz.

They are also available at libraries, service centres and local board offices.

After consultation closes on June 30, the local boards will review all feedback and use it to help shape the final local board plans. The final plans will be adopted by October 2017.",,status,,42877.68144,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,6,1.1298E+14,Media,1,0,1,1,0,1,1
112979752060616_1699725723386003,"Hospital stretcher action looks to highlight gaps in Auckland healthcare funding

Yesterday nurses in scrubs delivered a health funding petition on a stretcher to MP Nikki Kaye's office on College Hill, Freemans Bay..  
 
Auckland Emergency Nurse Hamish Hutchinson delivered a petition with 1,296 signatures from the Auckland District Health Board (ADHB) region. 

The petition urges restoring funding for healthcare services and was in time for this month's budget.
 
""It's an emergency situation,"" Hamish says. ""Since 2010, Government funding for ADHB hasn't kept up with a growing and ageing population and increasing costs.""

Since 2011 ADHB has made $153 million in 'efficiency gains,' says Hamish. 

""The ADHB spends $2,315 of funding per head of population while the national average is $2,540 per head of population. At the same time the population within the ADHB area has had a 15% increase, from approximately 1,405,500 in 2008 to 1,614,400 in 2016.
 
He says the underfunding is affecting all areas of the system, for example putting extra burdens on overworked staff. 

A recent YesWeCare.nz survey found nine out of ten people working at ADHB felt under-resourcing meant they couldn't give locals the health care they need, when they need it.

""I think it's clear the staff are really being squeezed and you're dealing with people and people's lives. As much as we try, our health services can't flourish in financial survival mode,"" Hamish says.
 
Hamish says the Auckland DHB should be supported to meet growing demands such as population growth, and not be forced to find more and more efficiencies.
 
""We are asking the Government to make up the missing $1.85 billion in this month's budget for all 20 DHBs,"" Hamish says. 

The $1.85 billion shortfall would pay for an extra 7400 doctors, 27,750 nurses or 111,000 hip operations he says.

""No matter what part of the country, no matter what income you receive, people should have equal access to good healthcare, and I feel like in New Zealand access is a real problem."" 

""So as long as you get into hospital you're going to get treated reasonably well but what's not captured is the access and the people who fall through the cracks,"" says Hamish.

An Auckland Bungy lover will attempt to set a new world record for the most Bungy jumps in 24 hours while raising money for the Mental Health Foundation. 

Bungy jumping enthusiast Mike Heard will make the attempt across 24 hours starting at 7pm Tuesday 23 May from the AJ Hackett Bungy New Zealand site at Auckland Harbour Bridge.

Mr Heard has previously set two Guinness World Records for Bungy jumping from the same location É?? the first in August 2008 when he jumped 103 times in 24 hours and then again in March 2014 when he jumped 80 times in just 60 minutes. 

His 24-hour record was later beaten and is currently held by Colin Phillips, who jumped 151 times in 24 hours in Dubai on March 21, 2014. Mr Heard hopes to ""absolutely smash"" the record this time around, after changes to the required length of rope means he will no longer have to be dunked in the Auckland Harbour.  

""This time around I'm aiming to get past 200 jumps É?? and if my 60-minute record is anything to go by (80 jumps in 60 minutes), I know this is possible. 

""For me, Bungy is about doing something I enjoy, doing something that has the ability to push me outside of my comfort zone and doing something that keeps me focused, footloose and fancy free. The Mental Health Foundation seems a good fit É?? and I'm really excited that I get to raise money for such a worthy organisation while doing something I absolutely love.""

The Harbour Bridge Bungy site will operate its usual business hours and jump times during the day. Jumpers will have an opportunity to join Mr Heard for a tandem Bungy or a Guinness experience with money going towards the fundraising total.

In 1976 I helped Motat with a searchlight at an Auckland Military Tattoo and I started attending after that, not full on, until about 1987 then a break away when my wife was ill, about 20 months. After her death, more full on with the military section.

When the sun goes down, possums relentlessly consume the forest canopy, slowly killing ancient forest giants. Rats, stoats and feral cats consume the native birds, bugs and lizards. Dean will talk about the waves of extinction on New Zealand's islands since human arrival and up to the current collapse of Northland's native forests - and how Forest & Bird is working with others to turn the tide. Dean has been described as New Zealand's dreadlocked David Attenborough with attitude. His knowledge and passion will make for a great evening. 7.30pm at The Gardens Community Hall, 5 Mt Lebanon Cres, Manurewa.

Following the KaipéÅtiki Local Board Meeting of 19/04/2017 and resolution CP2017/06008 the project to renew the play boat/pontoon at Hilders Park, more commonly known as ""Frank Larking's Boat"", has been handed to the Community Facilities Investigation and Design Team (I&D).

As the community has also raised concerns in regards to the furniture renewal at Hilders Reserve, in particularly with regards to the memorial seating, the project to renew the furniture has also been handed to I&D.

The I&D team plan to progress the boat and furniture projects jointly through the Investigation and design phase of the project. The I&D team plan to undertake the following next steps to progress these renewal projects:

1. Undertake further investigations to clarify the immediate health and safety obligations of Auckland Council in order to keep the existing boat in this location.
    * The boat is currently still open to public access.
    * I&D understand that the Board are to be kept informed 
       should the current situation change.

2. Undertake further investigations to clarify the ongoing health and safety obligations of Auckland Council if a play boat was kept in this location in some form (either through repair of existing, or a replica).

3. Gain good understanding of the community expectations and desired outcomes in regards to Hilders Park and Larking's Landing assets, in particular the memorial seats and the play boat.
      * This has already begun by I&D staff meeting with community representatives Ruth Jackson and Cindy Starnes on site and through reviewing the feedback on these projects to date.

4. Investigate further any heritage values associated with the boat and memorial seats.

5. Investigate options to retain the memorial seats in some form.

6. Investigate further the options to retain a play boat at Hilders Park, either through repair of the existing or a replica boat.
     * This will include the capital and operational costs associated with keeping a play boat in this location.
     * Costs will be sought from a qualified boat builder and will include ensuring the health and safety obligations for council

Auckland Council wants to know what people that live and work in the Auckland region think about changing shop trading rules to allow more businesses to open on Easter Sunday. 

A recent law change means Auckland Council can decide whether to allow more shops to open on Easter Sunday. 

The council's Governing Body has decided to ask Aucklanders whether they want the council to leave things as they are or create a policy to allow more shops to open. 

Currently, only some shops, like service stations, dairies, pharmacies and food outlets, are allowed to open on Easter Sunday. Supermarkets and general retailers must remain closed. 

Visit shapeauckland.co.nz to have your say. Feedback closes at 4pm on Sunday 11 June.

Auckland Council wants to know what people that live and work in the Auckland region think about changing shop trading rules to allow more businesses to open on Easter Sunday. 

A recent law change means Auckland Council can decide whether to allow more shops to open on Easter Sunday. 

The council's Governing Body has decided to ask Aucklanders whether they want the council to leave things as they are or create a policy to allow more shops to open. 

Currently, only some shops, like service stations, dairies, pharmacies and food outlets, are allowed to open on Easter Sunday. Supermarkets and general retailers must remain closed.

Thanks, David,  for creating such a positive work culture, and leading the delivery of some outstanding results for Auckland.

""Hi everyone

As many of you are aware, my term as Chief Executive of Auckland Transport is coming to an end. The Board will begin a recruitment process shortly and I wanted to ensure everyone had the same message from me.

My contract ends 31 December 2017. The Board will appoint a new CE in the next few months and I expect there will be a familiarisation period before my departure. We have no clarity on the exact timing of those events at this stage, but will keep you informed as things progress.

There will be ample opportunity to both reflect and project before the end of the year. At this stage, suffice to say, after spending seven enjoyable years in the role, I think AT is in good heart, has a strong Executive Team and the business is delivering outstanding results. We have a clear ""Vision"", a well-defined ""Mission"" and an effective set of ""Values"". Together these give AT a great culture and place to work. Moving on at this time allows the business to transition leadership with confidence and stability.

For me, the change will allow a little more free time and an opportunity to develop/return to other interests/challenges.

In the meantime, there is a lot on and high expectations of us to continue delivering transport solutions for Auckland. Let's stay focused to ensure we meet our daily challenges with a positive attitude.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/akltransport/photos/a.1644658632529264.1073741828.1643699942625133/1819043911757401/?type=3,42866.85557,21,4,0,17,1,0,2,0,0,71,1.6437E+15,CCO,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

Green MPs that stand up for our environment. Green MPs that stand up for public services. Green MPs that stand up for young people.

Auckland Council wants to know what people that live and work in the Auckland region think about changing shop trading rules to allow more businesses to open on Easter Sunday. 

A recent law change means Auckland Council can decide whether to allow more shops to open on Easter Sunday. 

The council's Governing Body has decided to ask Aucklanders whether they want the council to leave things as they are or create a policy to allow more shops to open. 

Currently, only some shops, like service stations, dairies, pharmacies and food outlets, are allowed to open on Easter Sunday. Supermarkets and general retailers must remain closed.

Every three years each local board develops a Local Board Plan, which helps to guide decisions on local activities and projects.

Plans reflect your community's priorities and preferences; they guide the regional strategies and plans of Auckland Council, and influence how we work with others for the benefit of our communities.

Devonport-Takapuna Local Board will be asking for your feedback about plans for your local community from Monday 22 May to  Friday 30 June, 2017

By sharing your feedback you'll be involved in:

- Helping shape the future of your local area
- Ensuring Local Board Plans reflect your community's preferences
helping us understand what you value most, so we prioritize what we deliver.

For now it would not make sense for Port of Auckland to shift their facility to Drury even though if they did it could mean the Manukau South Link would be built. Even if Metro Port went to Drury the Wiri facility would act as an intermediary hub supporting the Wiri industrial complex as well as Manukau. Given Wiri still has room to support more industry (and not under thread of a decamp) the Inland Port still has many years of growth in it. The Wiri Inland Port has also just gone major expansion to its facilities and is ramping up its shuttles between itself and Port of Auckland's wharves so even with possible duplication with Metro Port Wiri will be with us for a while to come.

That figure is now expected to be reached this year É?? 15 years ahead of the prediction. It is now forecast to grow by a further 30,000 residents over the next 10 years, which is the equivalent of half of the population of Rotorua relocating to the area within Auckland's inner motorway.
Renaissance of inner-urban living
Councillor Chris Darby, Chair of Auckland Council's Planning Committee, says we're witnessing the rapid renaissance of inner-urban living in the city centre.

Some parks in Auckland have been abandonned by the local council according to residents.
Casey Trent moved to Weymouth from the high-income suburb of Ponsonby two months ago - and noticed a huge difference in the state of her local park. 
""Initially I felt sad for everyone out here. It's like a stereotype - oh you live in South Auckland, you're not worth what people in Herne Bay are worth,"" she says.
""Is there not a budget for the whole of Auckland and not just per suburb?""
Auckland Council says there is.
""We would treat any situation where there is glass, graffiti, rubbish - the same across all our parks,"" Auckland Council's Agnes McCormack says.
Three former council contractors told Newshub higher income suburbs complain more to the council call centre. And that means they get more attention.  
The council admits it does rely on complaints.

John wants out, so he's taking a break from his high maintenance boyfriend. Liberated from Mr Co-Dependent, the last thing he's expecting is to suddenly meet the woman of his dreams. Now John's stuck in a total boy-meets-girl meets-boyfriend dilemma.

Caught in a maelstrom of possibility, guilt and indecision, John reckons there's only one way to straighten this all out.

Sometimes love is worth a good fight.
Mike Bartlett's thrilling and wickedly funny play takes on sexuality and its discontents. Bring him and her.

Bryan Cook is a property developer who has accumulated a small fortune building leaky homes. He's stressed out, self-medicating and self-loathing; killing himself to increase his bank balance while decreasing his golf score.

When things fall apart, he joins a men's cycling group to relieve the stress É?? and makes a few startling discoveries in various cracks and crevices.

Poignant and achingly funny, MAMIL presents the male mid-life crisis in all its lurid glory.

Both ward councilors, John Watson and Wayne Walker are opposed to another set of  lights, as are 3 of the 4 HBC local board members - Vicki Watson, Mike Williamson and Caitlin Watson.  All five say lights at this location will cause serious congestion on the Hibiscus Highway.
 Cr John Watson says that when this proposal was considered back in 2011, Auckland Transport rejected it emphatically saying it would cause major traffic hold ups back along the Whangaparaoa Peninsula and it would be dangerous - trucks would have difficulty coming to a stop safely at the bottom of the hill."" 
Now Auckland Transport have said they will undertake a feasibility study to once again consider installation of the traffic lights, including the provision of warning lights, a reduction in the speed limit to 50 km and the 'realignment' of the road. 
""The cost for this would run to millions of dollars  and the result would be gridlock on an already congested road É?? it's lunacy,"" says Watson. ""Both the local board leadership driving this proposal and AT have been told repeatedly that lights at this location will cause significant traffic problems but they will not listen."" 
Cr Wayne Walker says that what makes this proposal all the more difficult to understand is that there are already plans to extend  East Coast Road across the Weiti River by Pak and Save and  into Silverdale. 
""This will address the problem of access across the Highway and is part of an accelerated transport package for Silverdale already agreed to É?? the lights aren't needed."" 
The 3 Hibiscus local board members opposed to the lights are also concerned that the study is being advanced without consultation with the wider public and with no apparent regard for the impact on the thousands of commuters living on Whangaparaoa. They believe HBC motorists will be aghast at what's being proposed and will reject it categorically.",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/johnwatsonac/photos/a.1090301777688715.1073741829.904585476260347/1561608417224713/?type=3,42892.25422,5,2,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,19,9.04585E+14,Influencer,1,0,0,0,0,1,1

Albany Ward councillors John Watson and Wayne Walker voted against the controversial 'bed tax' targeted rate which was passed 11 -8 at last week's council meeting.
They did so largely because of the effects it will have on local businesses in the Albany Ward.
""This rate is just not fair to our local motel businesses,"" says John Watson. ""They are being charged a targeted rate for a service they don't receive.""
They don't receive any actual benefit from ATEED's tourist promotions which concentrate largely on event promotions in the city.
""Why should they pay a rate for a service they don't receive any benefit from? No one could really answer this at the meeting.""
The sums of money involved are significant É?? on the HBC the targeted rate amounts range from an extra $4000 to $16000 extra a year for local moteliers
This is on top of the commercial rates which they already pay which range from $13,000 to $52,000 per annum.
""Put them together and some of our moteliers will be paying from $17 K to $66 K a year in rates.""
To make matter worse some of their competitors in the region will not be getting charged the targeted rate É?? the outer parts of Auckland like Rodney and Franklin are exempted from the rate as are bed and breakfasts.
Hotels on strata title will be able to apply for a rate remission as will hotels who can show they have already forward booked customers. 
Hibiscus Coast and other Albany ward moteliers operate in a very price sensitive environment É?? when people book through the likes of Trivago and Trip Adviser relatively small sums of money can make all the difference when it comes to choosing a place to stay.
""This proposal has tried to substitute a targeted rate for a visitors' levy and it simply doesn't work.""
For the big city hotels the sums money involved are significant É?? some of the big hotels will be paying up to an extra $700,000 through this rate (on top of commercial rates of a similar magnitude). That will have also have implications for their businesses. 
Both John Watson and Wayne Walker agree that ratepayers shouldn't be paying for tourist promotion but say council could simply withdraw the $13.45 million of promotions until such times as a fair system can be worked out with the accommodation providers.",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/johnwatsonac/photos/a.1090301777688715.1073741829.904585476260347/1561590407226514/?type=3,42892.2433,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,12,9.04585E+14,Influencer,1,1,0,0,1,0,1

904585476260347_1520031218049100,"The Rodney Times is right - this meeting was a shambles and marred by petty infighting that will have done little to engender public confidence. I thought it might be useful, however, to give a little background to the comments made by Mr Barnett in Silverdale.

Firstly, earlier this year there was another Penlink meeting hosted by the local board on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce and Mr Barnett. The two ward councilors were not invited to this meeting, nor were three of the four Hibiscus Coast local board members (that means 5 of the 6 HBC representatives were not invited). All of us knew absolutely nothing about it. 

As a result of this a complaint was sent to the Board chair at the end of March who initially denied that it was a local board hosted event despite the fact the Chamber of Commerce had stated that it was so on their website. To be honest we're more focussed on working out a financial package that makes the project fly (and with those individuals who actually have the capability to do so) but my view is that in so far as those involved with these meetings go, far from looking to involve people they've actually been doing all they can to exclude them - councillors and local board members alike.

On Friday we had the curious situation then where Mr Barnett alleged that we don't bother to attend their meetings. It's a little hard to attend meetings you don't know anything about!! When we were invited to the one last year, we did attend the event down at the marae in Silverdale despite Mr Barnett saying that we didn't (the local board chair had to correct him on that). In reality I haven't even had a conversation with Mr Barnett...ever!!  When I did email him last year to thank him for the Chamber's involvement and to offer support, he didn't reply. When I've further  asked him twice  this week for a meeting  he's refused to respond yet again - hardly the spirit of collaboration. 

I would like to know though who the board member is who is giving Mr Barnett all his information  since he is clearly not getting it from any contact with us! Maybe it's that mystery Councillor who was at the centre of the dissolution of  the dysfunctional Rodney Council back in the early 2000s when she turned on all the other HBC councillors in order to maintain her own position and in so doing provoked such bitter infighting and division that Rodney became the first council in the history of NZ to be dismissed by the Minister of Local Government and replaced by a Commissioner. Surely it's not deja vu - the same person provoking discord again?
 
Whatever the answer it certainly appears to us if there are people on the local board playing petty politics with Penlink , looking to advance their own profile while simultaneously denigrating others. That's very disappointing and ultimately counterproductive.   

The public want to see all the elected representatives working together (as was commented on at the meeting). In this respect it was also uncalled for to attack the Rodney MP Mark Mitchell who has worked hard for Penlink and especially when efforts are also now being made to progress Penlink as a road of National Significance with the government, a government in which Mr Mitchell now holds a senior position É?? hardly the way to win friends and influence people.
Finally while it's certainly nice to see the Chamber conducting surveys showing the high level of public support and a willingness to pay tolls, that's hardly a newsflash to anyone. We've all known that for the last 20 years. Unfortunately just banging the drum and making a lot of noise doesn't actually progress anything É?? we all know that from the bitter experience of the last two decades.
 
Efforts have to be far more sophisticated than that and which concentrate on alternative sources of finance, and that's what we're absolutely focused on as councillors - coming up with an actual agreement that makes Penlink happen in advance of the current timetable - for there are parties genuinely interested in constructing it if the right financial package can be agreed upon that takes into account the complexities of the council's debt profile, future tolling income, NZTA subsidies and investor contribution and return. Unfortunately there were actually investors at this meeting that we have been working with this year regarding Penlink - I shudder to think what they made of the circus on Friday. 

Still, there is the clear requirement at the moment to be fully cognizant of the rapidly changing political and financial scene in Auckland. The sheer volume of housing enabled by the Unitary Plan passed at the end of last year now raises the possibility of Penlink being progressed, in whole or in part, as a road of elevated significance. And that most certainly requires a united front and more importantly, the appropriate financial package that satisfies all the relevant parties and progresses this project significantly ahead of time. So let's work together on this, no more petty posturing, self-promotion and denigration of others - we're all from the same community after all - no one person or group can do it alone - as with most things  it has to be a team effort that utilises people's collective abilities.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/johnwatsonac/photos/a.1090301777688715.1073741829.904585476260347/1520031218049100/?type=3,42856.95372,16,10,0,15,0,0,0,0,1,68,9.04585E+14,Influencer,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

Through the consultation process, educators, business and industry, parents, families and whanau will all be able to help the Ministry of Education shape the final content of the curriculum.

Budget 2017 included $436 million for the first stage of the City Rail Link to greatly boost the capacity of the commuter rail network in central Auckland.

- Progressed redevelopments at Bayfield School ($12 million) and Freemans Bay School ($19 million) as well as the $79 million redevelopment at Western Springs College (an important secondary school for Auckland Central residents).

- Progress on reform of the Unit Titles Act, affecting many  electorate residents of apartments. I started a campaign for change and have worked with a group of property professionals and the Minister for Building and Housing to improve the law. Proposals are currently being worked through covering improvements in dispute resolution and greater transparency of information for people living in apartments and townhouses.

- $88 million package of cycleways benefiting Auckland and Auckland Central.

-$40 million property investment for Waiheke Schools (Waiheke High School and Te Huruhi School).

-Rollout of ultra-fast broadband on Waiheke Island recently completed. This is hugely important for social and economic progress for island residents and businesses.

- Earlier this year I approached the Auckland council, Auckland Transport and the Mayor regarding greater investment and improved ferry services for Waiheke. They have confirmed they are now working on a revised ferry strategy which will cover Waiheke Island. 

-Advocated and helped deliver the opening of the Aotea Conservation Park and re-opening of the Aotea Track on Great Barrier Island. I am currently advocating for additional tourism funding for the island including giving greater national recognition to the Aotea track.

-Helped to ensure the learning hub is resourced for Great Barrier Island students. I am currently exploring the potential for tele-health services for the island.

-Improved cellphone reception for Great Barrier Island with a new cell site going live in the north of the island.

This investment will deliver four new schools:

- $22m for a new primary school in the Pukekohe Belmont area (planned roll of 350)
- $25m for a new primary school in Orewa North West area (planned roll of 420)
- $20m for a new primary school in the Drury area (planned roll of 370)
- $24m for a new kura in Manurewa, to house Te Kura Kaupapa Maoro o Manurewa and Te Wharekura o Manurewa

The package also includes:

- $20m phased expansion for Stonefields School, which will eventually provide 450 additional places
- $22m for co-location and rebuild of Carlson and Sunnydene special education schools on a new site
- $87 million for around 170 classrooms across Auckland, both new and replacement and $9 million for five new special education satellite units. 

We have now announced all nine of the new schools that were pledged in 2014. With the package announced today, a further 4000 student places will be delivered, on top of the 17,000 already announced. This means we are on track to deliver an extra 21,000 student places in Auckland by 2021.

In a world first, the energy required for the nearly 90,000 LED lights and 200 floodlights will be offset by solar and battery technology.

The LED lights will use half the energy and will last five times longer than standard lighting, and only need replacing every 10-15 years. The energy required will be offset by 700 solar panels installed near the Harbour Bridge where a large battery will store the energy. I know NZTA, council and vector have all worked together in strong partnership to make this happen.

This will provide six new schools, two school expansions, the relocation of two special education schools, 11 new special education satellite unites and around 305 new classrooms nationwide. 

To break this down; Auckland will see a total of $277.6m invested into projects including four new schools, one school expansion, the relocation and rebuild of two special education schools and around 170 more classrooms at schools across the city. This Government is getting ahead of growth, delivering 21,000 extra student places in Auckland from 2014 É?? 2021. 
Outside of Auckland, we continue to focus on providing fast-growing communities with significant investments in new schools and classrooms. 
#Budget2017 also provides $146.9m for school property including two new schools, one school expansion and 130 extra classrooms around the country.

#Budget2017 also provides $31.9m for land purchases to ensure we can build new schools to meet demand. 

Overall this Government has committed more than $5 billion towards school property, significantly more than any previous Government.

In 1874, when Kate was 16, she was given permission to attend Auckland Grammar as there was no secondary schooling available for girls at the time. She was the only girl in her class. 
Kate was a trailblazer and went on to gain a Bachelor of Arts in Latin and Mathematics. 
I spoke to the Grammar assembly about how success takes courage and Kate is a fantastic example of someone who showed resilence and determination to achieve what some people may have thought was impossible. Later in life she was active in the suffrage movement and involved in causes supporting women and children. We have much to owe women like Kate, who changed society through their convictions and determination, and who made the road easier for those who follow in their footsteps.

9055697956_10154615410177957,"There is no one answer to increasing the number of teachers or strengthening the profession which is why we are supporting a range of new initiatives. These build on the $9 million package announced by the previous Education Minister last year that was designed to help address teacher supply pressures and build and maintain a quality teacher workforce.

Firstly in the upcoming budget we will commit $5.2 million over the next four years to expand the innovative employment-based initial teacher education (ITE) programme provided by Teach First NZ to a further 90 participants.

We're also committing $2 million of operating funding over the next two years towards further induction and mentoring for provisionally-certificated teachers in priority areas to gain full certification.

I can also confirm today that the Education Council will be going out to tender for the provision of Teacher Education Refresher courses. The tender will aim to both improve the quality of these courses while also reducing the costs which I understand may be prohibitive for some teachers wishing to get full certification.

And from the beginning of next year we will lift the moratorium on new study programmes for teacher qualifications which has been in place since 2000.

In order to raise achievement it is crucial that we continue to improve the quality of teachers. The replacement of the Teachers Council with the Education Council has been an important step towards enabling the profession to raise standards in teaching. The Government has provided financial support to get the organisation up and running.

The Council is an independent statutory body mandated to lift the status of the teaching profession. They are focused on good teaching practice and helping to raise the status and image of the teaching profession. They have recently consulted on a new professional code which covers expectations of ethical behaviour and standards of professional practice for the teaching profession. They have also signalled that they have been reviewing the qualifications required for teachers to be able to practice. These are important pieces of work and I look forward to being briefed further by the council in the coming months on this work.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/NikkiKayeMP/photos/a.173129922956.123928.9055697956/10154615410177957/?type=3,42872.02274,22,1,0,21,1,0,0,0,0,68,9055697956,Influencer,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Both will be remembered for a long time to come and I have been fortunate to have worked alongside both of them in the good times and the bad. When I came back from London in 2008 to run for Parliament I met with Murray for a coffee. Most people with the exception of Murray told me it was an impossible task to win the nomination let alone the seat of Auckland central. Murray not only encouraged me to stand for the nomination but was always a phone call away when I was a newbie MP knocking on doors and meeting people in Auckland central. Murray has delivered so much particularly in the areas of high performance sport but also helping secure the top job for NZ on the UN Security Council. He is one of the longest serving ministers in our countries history. I never liked the oaky warm Chardonnay but I did love our political discussions –???As I have already said Hekia has been a superb colleague and a close friend. She is so capable and has delivered so much in education. She is in my view the best education minister we have ever had. Alongside her and her husband Sir Wira they have been so loyal and dedicated to the party for so long.
